							<p class="story-details">
								Slam Dunk centers around Hanamichi Sakuragi, who starts as a delinquent outcast, becoming the leader of a gang. Hanamichi, being very unpopular with girls, has been rejected by them fifty times. Yet, he finds out that Haruko Akagi is the girl of his dreams, and is happy when she's not scared of him like all the other girls he has asked out.
							</p>
                            <p class="story-details">
                                Haruko Akagi, who recognizes Hanamichi's athleticism, introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team. Hanamichi was reluctant to join the team at first because he had no previous background in any sports and thought that basketball was a game for losers (also because the fiftieth girl rejected him for a basketball player). Sakuragi, despite his immaturity and hot temper, proves to be a natural athlete with potential and joins the team in order to impress Haruko and prove that he is worthy of her. Kaede Rukawa — Sakuragi's bitter rival (both on the basketball court and love, even when Rukawa doesn't acknowledge Haruko's crush on him), the star rookie and a "girl magnet" - joins the team at the same time. Hisashi Mitsui, an ex-junior high school MVP (Most Valuable Player), and Ryota Miyagi, a short but fast player, both also rejoin the team and together these four struggle to complete team captain Takenori Akagi's dream of making Shohoku the national champion. Together, these misfits gain publicity and the once little known Shohoku basketball team becomes an all-star contender in Japan.

								<p>
									Miuradai is the first team Shohoku faces off against in the regional tournament. Sakuragi, Rukawa, Miyagi, and Mitsui have all been punished by Coach Anzai for fighting, and are not allowed to play. Akagi is, therefore, the only member of the formal starting line-up to play the game.

								<h4>Shohoku vs Shoyo</h4>
								<p>Score: 62-60</p>
								<p>
									Shoyo High School is the 2nd strongest team in Kanagawa behind Kainan. When Kenji Fujima joined Shoyo, he immediately became a star player and his biggest rival was Kainan's Shinichi Maki. Fujima has never been able to beat Maki and this year, got defeated by Shohoku, denying them access to the Prefectural top 4. In last year's Nationals Tournament Shoyo got eliminated by Toyotama, as Tsuyoshi Minami injured Shoyo's ace player Fujima.
                                    <br>
                                    Although seniors normally retire after the summer to focus on the College Entrance Examinations, all the seniors of Shoyo decided to stay in the team to participate in the High School Winter Tournament. Shoyo lost in quater-finals to Shohoku 60-62.

								<h4>Shohoku vs Kainan</h4>
								<p>Score: 90-88</p>
								<p>
									Kainan University Affiliated High School basketball team has won the Kanagawa Inter-High Tournament for 17 years running, and are known as the "Kings of Kanagawa." However, Kainan lost in the semifinals in the previous National Championship against the defending champion, Sannoh by 30 points. At the end of the manga, they finished as #2 in the National High School Tournament, losing the final match, supposedly to Daiei High School.
                                    <br>
                                    Kainan's starting players are Shinichi Maki, Soichiro Jin, Kiyota Nobunaga, Kazuma Takasago, and Tadashi Muto. Their coach is Riki Takato.

									Shohoku faces Ryonan again, after their previous practice match victory. This time however, they are coming in fresh of having their sensei recently be admitted to the hospital. On the other hand, Ryonan had just lost in overtime to Kainan, and are pumped up to win the game.

								<h4>Shohoku vs Toyotama</h4>
								<p>Score: 91-87</p>
								<p>
									When former coach, Kitano Jiei introduced the 80% offense and 20% defense tactic to the team, the team improved and became # 1 of Osaka and even managed to reach the Quarter-finals of the Inter-High. Everyone cheered on the Run & Gun playing style. The school invested a lot of money in the basketball club and demanded even better results. When Coach Kitano could not live up to the high expectations, he got fired.
                                    <br>
                                    The new coach, Kanehira is looking to strengthen the defense, which the team lacks. However, he is greatly disrespected most likely by Minami and Kishimoto who have great respect for Coach Kitano and still wants to live up the old system.
                                    <br>
                                    Eventually, the Prefectural Finals and the Inter-High became the prize for being an unstable team, having lost to Daiei and Shohoku.

						            An anime series, consisting of 101 episodes, was produced by Toei Animation and directed by Nobutaka Nishizawa. It was first broadcast on TV Asahi from October 16, 1993 to March 23, 1996. It was later aired on the satellite television network, Animax, in addition to four animated movies produced. The anime followed the manga storyline, but left out the National Tournament games. Toei compiled the episodes into a series of seventeen DVDs which were released in Japan from December 10, 2004 to May 21, 2005. Toei once again collected the series in three DVD boxes during 2008. All the three boxes have a total of seventeen discs. To celebrate 20 years since its broadcast, the anime was released on Blu-ray format.
